title: OSG 25 News

OSG 25 News
===========

**Supported OS Versions:** EL8, EL9, EL10 (see [this document](supported_platforms.md) for details)

OSG 25 is the third release series following our [annual release schedule](release_series.md) and includes support for
EL10. The initial release includes GlideinWMS 3.10.15, HTCondor 25.0.2, HTCondor 25.2.1, HTCondor-CE 25.0.1, and XRootD 5.8.4.

OSG 25 will be supported for [approximately two years total](release_series.md#series-life-cycle).


!!! info "OSG 23 end-of-life"
    Following our [release series support policy](release_series.md#series-life-cycle),
    OSG 23 has reached its end-of-life and will no longer be supported with the release of OSG 25.


!!! danger "Deprecation of the CVMFS OSG WN client `current` symlink"
    In January 2026, we plan to remove the the `current` symlink for the CVMFS-based OSG WN client,
    i.e. `/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/current`

Enterprise Linux 10
-------------------

### Microarchitecture ###

The x86-64 architecture contains multiple subversions with different CPU feature sets, referred to as
[microarchitectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels)
Support for x86-64-v2, released in 2008, [has been dropped from RHEL 10](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7066628), 
Centos Stream 10, and Rocky Linux 10. Almalinux 10 continues support for v2 and has dedicated
[Yum repositories](https://almalinux.org/blog/2025-06-26-epel-v2-now-covers-almalinux-10-stable/) for these packages.

Before EL10, all OSG Software `x86_64` packages were built against the v2 microarchitecture.
Starting in EL10, OSG Software `x86_64` architecture packages are built against the v3 microarchitecture,
while a separate `x86_64_v2` architecture is maintained to support v2 Almalinux 10. 
`yum` will automatically select the correct `$basearch` for your host when 
[installing the OSG yum repos](../common/yum.md).

### EPEL ###

In EL10, the EPEL repositories have minor versions that correspond to your operating system's minor versions
(see [this presentation](https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/events/attachments/fosdem-2025-6844-the-road-to-epel-10/slides/238616/the-road-_Ny3Et4L.pdf) for details).
As a result, there are packages missing from EPEL 10.0 that are availabe in EPEL 10.1 or EPEL 10.2.
CentOS Stream 10 installations will point at the latest EPEL sub-version but other EL variants will need to upgrade OS
minor versions to access packages in newer EPEL sub-versions.

Note that at the time of this writing, Alma Linux, RHEL, and Rocky Linux have not released 10.1 or above.

    !!! bug "Issue in previous gratia-probe-htcondor-ce release"
        If you previously installed gratia-probe-htcondor-ce 2.9.1, please move any held records back into the 
        processing directory for reprocessing:

        1.   Confirm that `PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR` is set in your HTCondor config:  
            ```
            $ condor_ce_config_val PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR

    !!! note
          If you have multiple workers, you must use the [Rock cache](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Rock_cache)

    -   Addressed security vulnerability [SQUID-2025:2 Information Disclosure in Error handling](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/security/advisories/GHSA-c8cc-phh7-xmxr)
    -   Add support for Enterprise Linux 10.
    -   Disable admin emails from shoal-agent.
    -   Changed pip3 install of obsolete Python module `netifaces` to new `netifaces-plus` to  enable shoal-agent to run on EL10.
    -   Fixed setting permissions of shoal-download directories to prevent `Permission denied` errors.
    -   During build of source RPM, download additional Python modules `cffi` and
        `typing_extensions` to support building EL9 and EL10 from source RPM on OSG
        build machines where downloading is disabled.
    -   Support updating from frontier-squid-5 to this version.
    -   [Upgrade to 6.14-1 tarball](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/releases/tag/SQUID_6_14)
    -   Add an `ignore_vary` option to prevent Vary headers (like those from
        Cloudflare) from interfering with caching in Rock cache, and enable
        that option by default.
    -   Add a default value of `shared_transient_entries_limit 1048576` to
        reduce the chances of clashing hashes of queries while using
        multiple workers.  A clashing hash causes a query to not be cached.
        This increased value could use up to 128MB of shared memory.
    -   Restored text of error messages that appear in rare cases and that were
        missing from the previous release.
    -   Improved checks for cache memory configuration to allow multiple services to
        have their own cache memory values and to prevent reduction in configured
        cache memory during re-starts. Also, increased safety buffer of shared memory from 10% to 20%.
    -   Removed obsolete in2p3, gridpp, and triumf from `acl ATLAS_FRONTIER`.
    -   Add a patch from v7 to avoid a `slot->sameKey()` assertion error in
        `rock/RockSwapDir.cc` that has been seen with multiple workers and
        causes one worker to restart and prevent a query from being cached
        until a full restart.

-   osg-pki-tools 3.7.4
    -   Change the certificate term for osg-incommon-cert-request from
        395 days to 199 days because that is now the maximum allowed
